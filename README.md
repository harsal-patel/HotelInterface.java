# HotelInterface.java
Small project created while learning GUI on Java in IntelliJ. Opens a hotel management system where a user can check guests in and out, view rooms and their availability,
view in-house guests, and advance the business day. Interfaces keeps track of the current date and uses this date when guests are checked in.
